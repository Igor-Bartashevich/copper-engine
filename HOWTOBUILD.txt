You need "gradle 1.3" to build COPPER.

To build all COPPER projects, just execute
gradle assemble
in the projects root directory.

Furthermore, to run or unit test COPPER, you need the Oracle 11gR2
JDBC driver. Add the Oracle JDBC driver jarfiles (ojdbc6_g.jar and
orai18n.jar) to the "libs" directory in the projects root directory.

To open COPPER with eclipse, just type 
gradle eclipse
in the projects root directory and open the corresponding projects
with the eclipse IDE.

Have fun!
