You need Apache Ant to build COPPER.

To build all COPPER projects, just execute
ant publish-all
in the projects root directory.

You need the eclipse ivy plugin (http://ant.apache.org/ivy/ivyde/) 
to edit the COPPER subprojects in eclipse.

Furthermore, to run or unit test COPPER, you need the Oracle 11gR2
JDBC driver.
Create a new eclipse CLASSPATH variable ORACLE_JDBC_HOME that 
points to the directory that contains the corresponding jar files 
(ORACLE_JDBC_HOME/ojdbc6.jar and ORACLE_JDBC_HOME\orai18n.jar).

Have fun!
