COPPER 2.4
==========
- New feature: engine.run throws DuplicateIdException if an existing workflow instance id is used - this is also implemented for the transient engine which substitutes throwing an IllegalStateException
- New feature: Default value for property "loadNonWorkflowClasses" in "FileBasesWorkflowRepository" changed from false to true, due to various problems, e.g. Switch-case not workling out-of-the-box
- Bugfix: ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException and other exceptions during workflow instrumentation when extensively using nested blocks and local variables

COPPER 2.3
==========
- New feature: Extended JMX interface
- New feature: COPPER now allows for multipe responses for the same correlationId - see new method Workflow.getAndRemoveResponses(..)
- New feature: Custom persistence - persist application specific data in extra database tables and columns. This enables viewing (and modifying) data with standard SQL
- New feature: Monitoring GUI (beta)
- Maintenance: Now using ASM 4.1 
- Bugfix: Timeout signaled for missing responses in case of WaitMode.FIRST
- New feature: generic return value for RetryingTransaction

==========
- internal development release - not published

COPPER 2.1
==========

- New feature: Refactoring of StandardJavaSerializer to enable easy subclassing
- New feature: Batching latency time now configurable
- New feature: Extendable/customizable AuditTrail, see issue #38
- New feature: Disengageable early response handling, see issue #37

- Documentation enhancement: Compatibility rules for workflow modifications
- Documentation enhancement: Revised example copper project

COPPER 2.0
==========
- New feature: Check consistency of all workflow instances during startup (optional) - IDs of inconsistent workflows are logged
- Bugfix: Incorrect handling of INVALID workflow instances

- New feature: custom stale response timeout
- New feature: Workflow classname in DB - for debugging/monitoring
- New feature: New property for DBStorage: staleResponseRemovalTimeout
- Bugfix: in instrumentation: Bad exception handling may cause non deterministic behavior
- New feature: Implement a custom batch runner. Used e.g. for custom transaction handling 
- New feature: Allow custom seqnr for audit trail events
- New feature: Store exceptions during "registerCallback/wait" in database error table
