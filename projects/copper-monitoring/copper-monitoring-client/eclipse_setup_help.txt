associate javadoc for javafx with gradle plugin:

Do as follows with a recent version of gradle tools:

    in menu 'Gradle >> Disable Dependency Management'
    then 'Gradle >> Refresh All'

By turning of 'Dependency management' you are switching the tooling to 'hands off' mode. 
And when you 'Refresh All' what it actually does is run the 'cleanEclipse eclipse' tasks and then refresh the workspace resources. 
This will generate a .classpath file with correct javadoc attachements.
