How to run the COPPER performance test
======================================

1. checkout COPPER
git clone https://github.com/copper-engine/copper-engine.git copper
cd copper

2. build the performance test jarfile
gradlew :projects:copper-performance-test:jar

3. prepare the database
  a) Oracle, MySQL, Postgres: create the database, user and schema - see https://github.com/copper-engine/copper-engine/tree/master/projects/copper-coreengine/src/main/database 
     for the correspnding SQL files
  b) H2, DerbyDB: The database schema is created by COPPER performance test during startup.
  c) Apache Cassandra: create a new keyspace, or use an existing one. The database schema is created by COPPER performance test during startup.
  
4. see usage of the performance test
cd projects/copper-performance-test/build/libs/
java -jar copper-performance-test.jar

5. start the test as described in the usage, e.g. to start the latency performance test using an embedded H2 database:
java -Dds.jdbcURL="jdbc:h2:mem:copperPerfTestH2DB;MVCC=TRUE" -Dds.driverClass=org.h2.Driver -jar copper-performance-test.jar latency
